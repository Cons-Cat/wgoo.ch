			  The <i>Superstar Game Suite</i> is a framework and editor for narrative-driven 2.5d platformers. Providing complex collision, generative graphics, dialogue, cutscenes, cinematography, poly-building, multi-layered tile editing, NPCs, 16-directional animation, and more.

			  <br>
			  <i>libCat</i> is a C++20 runtime for Linux.
			  This provides essential low-level tools for application development, such as syscalls, graphics, SIMD, atomics, threads, allocators, and more, as well as many modern zero-overhead meta-programming abstractions. This has unit tests and a build-system.

			  <br>
			  This demo was made in C++17 with DirectX 11 while I was in college. It has vertex, fragment, and geometry shaders, a normal map, 3D lighting, a height map, a skybox, undulating water, semi-transparent textures, a first-person flying camera, and a programmatically generated world.

			  <br>
			  I gave <a href="https://youtu.be/WIhC37Ym4To">a presentation</a> about an early demo of this. I raytraced pixel-art by providing color, normal, and depth maps for sprites, in C++20. Previously I tried a Vulkan depth-sorting approach. Neither of these can have the performance characteristics I want, so I will revisit this in the future.

			  <i>Super Fangame Maker</i> is a level editor awarded "The Most Overlooked" for MFGG Awards 2015. It has many features cloned from Super Mario Maker and based on fandom references, including item boxes, costumes, level themes, multiple gameplay engines, dynamic 9-slices, saving/loading levels, and more. I chronicled its development on my YouTube channel. The <a href="https://youtu.be/5cLho72S05M">most notable video</a> reached 21k views.
