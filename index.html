		&emsp;My name is William Gooch. Welcome to my website! I am a game developer interested in computer graphics, Linux, low-level systems, and state-of-the-art technology in those areas. I love talking about computers, programming languages, operating systems, fanfiction, text editors, and terminal emulators.
	  </p>
	  <p>
		&emsp;I am especially interested in modern and future C++, GNU Emacs, and Vulkan.

		&emsp;This website is structured entirely with HTML, and a small amount of CSS is optionally provided for web browsers which support it. There is no Javascript, Web Assembly, jQuery, PHP, WebGL, WebGPU, or whatever else is supposedly required to express information on a modern website.
	  </p>
	  <p>
		&emsp;I consider the ecological sustainability and accessibility of future technology, and I build software for solving tangible problems and serving a user. Check out my content here!
