		&emsp;I am amazed by how easy it is to learn basic web design. Knowledge is more readily available that any other programming domain I have dabbled in throughout my life, which makes some sense. Most professional programmers are building websites, as far as I can tell, but I have mostly been interested in desktop applications so far.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	  &emsp;I do regret not building a website until now. My dad purchased a different domain when I was a teenager, which I never made use of. I would have been well-served by maintaining a website in my adolescence, but the past is passed.
	  </p>
	  <p>
		&emsp;In my childhood, I had not heeded technical philosophy or the wisdom of counter-cultural programmers like Mike Acton, Terry Davis, Casey Muratori, et. al. Had I designed a website at that time, I most certainly would have been influenced by the programmers who I knew personally. They were mostly game developers and artists using interpreted programming languages (as was I), and one talented graphics designer whose now-dead XenForo message board stands amongst the most beautiful I have ever seen. For whatever that's worth.
	  </p>

		&emsp;Today, I know a lot more about computers, and hold technical opinions with stronger and more informed conviction than I had as a child or teenager. Page weight is a <a href="https://blog.chriszacharias.com/page-weight-matters">significant accessibility concern</a>, to the extent that <a href="https://www.brow.sh/">sophisticated technology</a> is employed, <a href="https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/javascript-trap.en.html">moral conundrums</a> have somehow been introduced, and no shortage of <a href="https://www.gdcvault.com/play/1023967/The-Flash-Games">technological controversy</a>.

		&emsp;There is much more to say about WebGL, Electron, React, Typescript, and other frustrating web-based technologies, but I'm sure any reader has heard many of the arguments, and already holds some opinion. Since becoming frustrated with the (unrelated) technologies I was using as a teenager, my perspective as an engineer has shifted towards developing tools to solve my tangible problems. Some of the projects hosted on this website are specific examples, but this website itself is also one.

		&emsp;My blog is written in HTML, without a content management system, static site generator, or Javascript components. I have authored CSS, but it is not responsible for the structure of text anywhere in my website. For that reason, it is completely reasonable to browse my blog with a pure HTML renderer. I think that it is unfortunate the Internet is reasoned about in terms of "content" and "style", rather than "text" and "graphics", for otherwise effects such as the drop shadow you might be seeing would be orthogonal to the layout of text. An unsophisticated web browser would be completely reasonable for browsing any static website, unlike status quo.
	  </p>

		&emsp;That there are practically only three supposedly-modern web browsing engines is slightly appaling to me. How can a society allow itself to become so deeply dependant on a technology that some human, or a small team of humans, couldn't possibly reproduce? The SerenityOS web browser is an interesting project, but I doubt that it will ever achieve <i>actual</i> feature parity with Firefox's renderer and runtimes, even if you exclude Shockwave Flash. That is not to mention whichever future features Firefox will have, after WebGPU is considered boring and W3C thinks up something new. WebKit is generally considered vastly inferior to Chromium or Firefox, and Firefox has been steadily losing market-share now. Microsoft recently abandoned their own browser engine, which was once accused of monopolizing the browser space, and it seems to me that we are converging onto a browser monoculture.
	  </p>

		&emsp;I am often browsing my blog, and editing it, using the Emacs Web Wowser, a pure HTML browser which, due to some challenging problems with GNU Emacs' renderer, isn't even a feature-complete HTML renderer. Still, it is a completely reasonable way to browse this website, and I have found that many GNU Emacs users value the simplicity and elegance of a website that can be interfaced with in such a low-technology manner. I believe that this website could be usable in a day and age when silicon is scarce, the ozone layer nearly vanished, and Chromium simply cannot be run on whichever computers the desparate remnants of humanity have fished out of the ocean, or have dug out from landfills.

		&emsp;I cannot solve problems in the web-space, obviously, but I can try to improve the state of its alternatives. As Mike Acton said, "the problem is the problem", and for any real problem that people have in the world, the need to compute profit margins or edit an essay, the solution is a computer program. It's not a Javascript applet, it's a <i>computer program</i>. Whether that is or is not a Javascript applet is an orthogonal concern, but I should like to remember that the technologies I use is not what a problem is, what my software actually does is the problem.
